# Amazon-clone-project

Hii everyone, I made this amazon clone using basic HTML and CSS.
I made this project with the help of Youtube naming the channel Apna College by Shraddha Khapra. I used the basic tags of HTML and basic styles of CSS. It is quite similar to the home feed of real amazon site. It was a great learning of basic HTML and CSS.
